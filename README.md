Description: AAC.java is a program that works as an AAC (or Augmentative and Alternative Communication) device. These are meant to assist disabled people who have speech-impairment with communication. With the help of AACCategory.java and AACMapping.java, images can be mapped to text, so when a person clicks on an image, if it's a category, it brings up a page of items that when clicked will generate speech of the text associated with the image. These images and texts are all determined by the person using it. To preload the program with images, texts, and categories, do so in AACMappings.txt. Images, text, and categories can also be added while the program is running. Finally, one can save their configurations by clicking on the save button.<br><br>
